## Story
The world is saved. The cost is forgotten.

In a neon-drenched future, humanity finds solace in the hyper-realistic virtual world of WonderNet 999, maintained by the benevolent Sweet-N-Crispy Magical Corp. Its guardians are the Battle Bride-maidens—elite warriors, beloved celebrities, and the saviours of mankind. But their beautiful image is a lie.

Cherry Blossompunch knows the rot beneath the petals.

Once a renowned battle bride-maiden, Cherry now lives in self-imposed exile. She is consumed by the guilt of a training incident that left her best friend and partner, Lila, a hollow shell in a hospital bed. While the corporation cleared her of all blame, Cherry remains shackled by the memory, visiting Lila's silent form in a relentless ritual of penance.

Her life is a quiet struggle under the immense shadow of her mother, Amaryllis—the first and most legendary bride-maiden, martyred in service. But Cherry is beginning to suspect her mother's legacy, and the world she saved, is built on a foundation of blood and lies.

The fragile peace shatters when Cherry discovers a chilling pattern—a digital ghost in the machine—that suggests Lila's accident was no accident at all. Her quiet investigation triggers a silent alarm.

Now, she is hunted. Not just by the corporation's impeccably polite and ruthless enforcers, but by her former sisters. The Bride-maidens operate on a brutal social Darwinist creed: *"prune the weak."* They see Cherry's quest as a betrayal of their sacred tenets and are eager to "Winter" a fallen sister who refuses to forget.
