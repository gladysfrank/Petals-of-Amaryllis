## Logline
In a dystopian future, the ronin return. Elite women, discarded, battling for survival against tech and tyranny.

---

## Story
Once the strongest, the Battle Bride-maidens now drift through a world that doesn’t need them. Discarded, their power forgotten, their purpose gone. In the quiet ruin of their glory, a woman, rumoured to be Amaryllis’s daughter, appears at the gates of the Sweet-N-Crispy clan, carrying a request no one can yet make sense of.

## The World
<details> <summary>Click to expand world details (contains minor spoilers)</summary> <br>
Sweet-N-Crispy Clan: Once the patrons of the world’s saviors, now a sprawling mansion and courtyard where power, protocol, and prestige hide a legacy of secrets and ruthless ambition.

Battle Bride-Maidens: Elite women who once defended humanity, now discarded and struggling. Their strength is admired, feared, and exploited, while only a few find a place in a society that no longer values them.

The Unreturned: Those who pushed too far, who broke under expectation or experiment, left as husks. They linger as silent reminders of what the world discards.

WonderNet 999: A shimmering virtual realm, humanity’s refuge and its cage. The world beyond the screens thrives, while the heroes who built it are forgotten.
